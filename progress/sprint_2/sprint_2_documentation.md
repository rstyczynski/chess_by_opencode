- Complete test coverage including error cases
- Well-structured implementation with shared package extraction
- Excellent user documentation for both API and CLI_REST
- Proper CORS and error handling documentation

**Areas for Improvement:**
None identified

## Recommendations

- Document session persistence options for scaling
- Maintain current documentation quality standards for Sprint 3

## Status

Documentation phase complete - All documents validated and README updated.

## YOLO Mode Decisions

This sprint documentation was completed in YOLO (autonomous) mode. The following decisions were made:

### Decision 1: README Update Strategy
**Context**: Need to update README with Sprint 2 completion
**Decision Made**: Added Sprint 2 as completed and updated active sprint to Sprint 3
**Rationale**: Reflects current project status accurately
**Alternatives Considered**: Keep Sprint 2 as active, minimal update
**Risk**: Low - accurate status representation

### Decision 2: Documentation Structure
**Context**: Need to document both API server and CLI_REST client
**Decision Made**: Comprehensive documentation covering both components
**Rationale**: Both components are core deliverables
**Alternatives Considered**: Separate documentation, API-only focus
**Risk**: Low - complete coverage is better

### Quality Exceptions
**Minor Issues Accepted**: None - all documentation meets quality standards
**Rationale**: Implementation and documentation are comprehensive and accurate
