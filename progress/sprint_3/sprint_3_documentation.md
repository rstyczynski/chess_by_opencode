## YOLO Mode Decisions

This sprint documentation was completed in YOLO (autonomous) mode. The following decisions were made:

### Decision 1: Web UI Documentation Strategy
**Context**: Need to document both React components and web interface
**Decision Made**: Comprehensive documentation covering all components and usage
**Rationale**: Complete coverage for web development team
**Alternatives Considered**: Component-only docs, API-only focus
**Risk**: Low - thorough documentation is valuable

### Decision 2: README Update for Complete Project
**Context**: Need to update README to reflect all three sprints completion
**Decision Made**: Added Sprint 3 as completed and updated project status
**Rationale**: Accurately reflects complete chess application
**Alternatives Considered**: Incremental updates, minimal changes
**Risk**: Low - accurate status representation

### Decision 3: Documentation Structure
**Context**: Need to document web development patterns and integration
**Decision Made**: Detailed documentation of React, Vite, and Tailwind integration
**Rationale**: Provides complete development guide
**Alternatives Considered**: High-level overview only
**Risk**: Low - comprehensive documentation supports future development

### Quality Exceptions
**Minor Issues Accepted**: None - all documentation meets quality standards
**Rationale**: Implementation and documentation are comprehensive and accurate
